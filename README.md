# browser-game
Tic Tac Toe in the browser. Practice JavaScript, HTML, and CSS site.

Using the README as more of a brainstorming area for this project. 
Going to start off by making the logic of the game work in the browser console.

Components of the game:
1) Player Object
2) Computer Object
3) Game Board Object
4) Game Loop

Starting off with the Game Board to give us somewhere to play. Sticking to the 
idea of having as little gloabl code as possible - we will use a factory function
wrapped inside of a IIFE since we only need one instance of the game baord.
